## 2026-09-18 - Pre-index visits by date key for calendar rendering
**Learning:** `PatientStatsComponent` generated calendar day cells (35–42 cells per grid) by invoking `.filter()` across all patient visits for every cell, executing `O(CELLS * VISITS)` timestamp parsing and date matching. Pre-building an `O(N)` map keyed by `YYYY-MM-DD` reduces lookups to `O(1)`.
**Action:** When rendering calendar/grid components displaying visits or appointments, check if events are filtered per cell and pre-aggregate into a date-keyed Map beforehand.
